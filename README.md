## Features

## Fully Customizable Screensharing Quality, FPS, and Bitrate

Stream at any resolution, framerate, and bitrate you want! Who needs Nitro?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Emoji Bypasses

Allows you to seamlessly use animated emojis and emojis from any server you're in by linking or uploading them!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Upload Emotes

Automatically uploads the emojis used in your message as an attachment!

![Uploading Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/191621033-da0db3f6-c5f6-4ba7-9c99-0c8ccf7ed864.gif)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Ghost Mode 
<!-- spoopy!!! -->
Hide the link(s) to any emoji(s) you send by automatically using a "ghost message"! It is a bit more laggy and may be detected as spam by some bots.

![Ghost Mode Image Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/166120840-50bd98c7-48d0-4772-8d9b-17280e247a02.png)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Hyperlink / Vencord-Like Mode

Puts the emoji into a hyperlink like Vencord fakemojis.

![vencord-like demo gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15df9ce9-cb2d-4ada-9070-2fd80e47db0e)

#### Fake Inline Hyperlink Emojis

The Fake Inline Hyperlink Emojis option will replace these hyperlinks with fake emojis on the client side.

Disabled:

![inline_off](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e96b02-57ae-4346-bcf9-b8b9d758e918)

Enabled:

![inline_on](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86668cb7-2c69-4788-9b35-5c8e4d2dd5f9)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Classic Mode

Simply replaces the emoji in the message with its' URL. This is "classic mode".

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Usage of the Emoji Bypass

![Emoji Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/166121643-58b06bc5-c0a5-4e45-a7e9-c135337b7ed0.gif)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Profile

### Profile Accents for All Users

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/199860419-7e3275e0-fdf5-49cf-a7c3-89f3105d1867.png" alt="visual difference with it on" width="25%"></img><--[New Look] [Original Look]--><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/199860495-19312500-3f37-4c3d-a54a-1c04af68e826.png" alt="visual difference with it off" width="25%"></img>

To clarify: What this does is make **all profiles** render with the gradient accent on the **client-side**.

We'll get into profile accents that other users can see in a second.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Fake Profile Themes

Allows profile theming by hiding color information in your bio using invisible 3y3 encoding!<br>
Works effectively exactly the same as FakeProfileThemes on Vencord, but on BetterDiscord!

![Fake Profile Themes Demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/dcb7b2fb-fdad-4d2d-8d87-b79fcabd8e9a)

Happy theming!

**Note that only users that have either YABDP4Nitro, FakeProfileThemes (Vencord), UnrealProfileThemes (Enmity), or a similar plugin (that decodes 3y3-encoded profile colors) installed will be able to see the profile colors.**

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Fake Profile Banners

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting profile banners by hiding the image URL in your bio.<br>
Only supports Imgur URLs for security reasons.

![Fake Profile Banners Big Yosher](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/f7edda1f-531b-45b8-bc8b-ee50d5c5cfdb)

To use Fake Profile Banners, go to Settings>Profiles. You should see a new text input and 
"Copy Banner 3y3" button under the Profile Banners section:

![Banner Tutorial Sceenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0f5620b-af4a-48e9-b196-1e41f8d09f33)

Simply type/paste in an Imgur URL into the input area

( ex: **`https://i.imgur.com/bYGGXnq.gif`** )

Then, click the "Copy 3y3" button to the right of the input area, paste your clipboard into your "About Me" (or bio) and save.

The banner should appear in the "Try It Out" preview to let you know that it is working correctly.

**Note that only other users with YABDP4Nitro installed and enabled will be able to see this.**
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Fake Avatar Decorations

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting avatar decorations by hiding IDs in your bio or custom status.

![avatar decoration demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/005379d8-5d6f-43e9-8735-b44788560831)

To use Fake Avatar Decorations, go to Settings>Profiles you should see a new button under Avatar Decoration.

![deco-button](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/0b5547e0-2947-4628-a3da-a91f9ee1c933)

Clicking this button will reveal a menu with each of the avatar decorations in a grid.

![avatar decorations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eff51466-6d05-4ab3-99f5-1308c04a9876)


Clicking one of these avatar decorations will copy the invisible 3y3-encoded data into your clipboard.
<br>Now follow one or both **(for the best effect, do both!)** of the following methods to apply the avatar decoration to your profile:


<details>
 <summary>
 Custom Status 
</summary>
 Now that you have the 3y3 encoded data in your clipboard:
 
 Close settings by pressing Escape or hitting the button labeled ESC in the top right.

 Click on your profile in the bottom left to open this menu:
 
 ![profile](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/2e48a60a-b235-48fd-a93f-b14c6a2ba695)

 Click the button to add/edit your custom status and paste your clipboard into your status.

 **Note that if you are using the Custom Status method only, it will only appear for other YABDP4Nitro users when you are online.**

 You should now see the avatar decoration appear around your profile picture!
</details>

<details>
 <summary>
 About Me / Profile Bio
</summary>
 Now that you have the 3y3 encoded data in your clipboard:
 <br>Paste your clipboard into the About Me section of your profile.

 Demonstration:
 
 ![decoration demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/b91fcd6e-389f-4adf-aa92-054d3e18d524)

 **Note: If your Avatar Decoration is in the About Me section of your profile, it will only appear for other users *after* they have opened your profile at least once.**
 
</details>

<br>
Any other user of YABDP4Nitro with Fake Avatar Decorations enabled will now be able to see your avatar decoration.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Fake Profile Effects

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting profile effects by hiding IDs in your bio.

![profile effect example](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/d9a2b6a4-dcdb-4fef-9310-5af30dffbfe6)

To use Fake Profile Effects, first go to Settings>Profiles; you should see a Profile Effect section:

![Profile Effect section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22b7473b-b1ad-4c7a-9cf4-922a8fd133a8)

Clicking the new "Change Effect \[YABDP4Nitro\]" button should reveal a menu with all of the available profile effects: 

![profile effect section opened](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93e79c7-acfc-4464-8717-8114c7d18c32)

<br>(The menu will automatically populate with any new profile effects that Discord may add in the future.)

Clicking one of these profile effects will copy the invisible 3y3-encoded data into your clipboard.
<br>Now all you have to do is paste your clipboard into the "About Me" section of your profile and click Save Changes!

![profile effects settings demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/7b2f8340-be41-4155-a0b5-77d37220d278)

Any other user of YABDP4Nitro with Fake Profile Effects enabled will now be able to see your profile effect!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Fake Profile Pictures

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting custom profile pictures by hiding an image URL in your status.
<br>Only supports Imgur URLs for security reasons.

![fake-pfp demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/07745802-005a-40b1-9655-b1cb8e0ecfa6)

To use Fake Profile Pictures, first go to Settings>Profiles; you should see a new input & button:

![fake pfp setting section](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/99adab5d-5d69-4e1d-ae84-f094b2cb782e)

Now paste an Imgur URL (ex: `https://i.imgur.com/bYGGXnq.gif`) into the box and click the "Copy 3y3" to the right!

![fakepfp demo](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/a7aba7b6-f947-4b2a-b2c2-696692ce7abc)

Assuming nothing goes wrong, you should see "3y3 copied to clipboard!" appear at the bottom of the window.

Now, close Settings and click your profile in the bottom left of the window.
<br>You should see the following:

![profile](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/60173742-79bb-4dfe-9a99-1aed2a250682)

Choose the option to set your custom status, and paste your clipboard anywhere into your custom status.

You should now see your profile picture change to the desired image!

Note that only other others of the plugin will be able to see your fake profile picture.

**Note: Because this uses Custom Status, you must be appearing Online, Idle, or Do Not Disturb for this to work!**

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Clips

![Clips Kung Fu Panda Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b140c90a-4688-4e91-b696-97f01d314e5c)

Increases the file upload limit for video files to 100 MB by sending them as "Discord Clip"s.

It works by first using FFmpeg.WASM to transmux to "isom"-branded MP4 without re-encoding (unless it's already an "isom"-branded MP4),
and then appending a special tag that the Discord API specifically checks for to the file in order for it to be considered "valid".

The plugin does everything automatically, so all you'll need to do is upload the video as you usually would, and enjoy the higher 100MB file limit!

## Discord Server

Please read [this README](#readme) and [the FAQ](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/issues/76) before joining just to ask stupid questions that 100 people have already asked before. It's really annoying.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Donate

If you want to show your love for the plugin, (or just put a middle finger to Discord's face) it would really mean the world to me if you threw me a few bucks. Very few people actually donate, so I see and appreciate every last one.

Methods of donations without fees are obviously preferred. See more info below.

To avoid repeating myself, assume that an additional 3% fee will be applied if you use a credit card.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### P2P

Using a P2P payment processor will ensure that 100% of your donation will be received and none will be taken by transaction fees (unless you choose to use an instant transfer).


### Venmo

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Payment Processor(s) with no fee

GitHub Sponsors is the only one I've found so far.

#### GitHub Sponsors

-Have to use a credit or debit card.

Apparently **no credit card fee** either? Someone test this for me ;)

https://github.com/sponsors/riolubruh

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Payment Processors with a fee


Using one of these will subtract some fee, either taking the fee from you or from me (usually from me).

#### Ko-fi

Routed through PayPal, so [same fee as PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/paypal-consumer-fees#ReceivingDonations).

<a href='https://ko-fi.com/N4N5L05NP' target='_blank'><img style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3' border='0' alt='Send me some dosh at ko-fi.com' /></a>

#### PayPal

I will be able to see your full name and email if PayPal is used.<br>
Although I won't do anything with it, if this makes you uncomfortable, consider using something else.

Donation fee of 2.89% of payment + $0.49 ( + 1.5% if you're not in the United States + currency conversion if applicable) taken from me.

<a style="height:36px;" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=U5PZFBNGKSGFQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img style="height:36px;" src='https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif'></a><br>
[Fees Info](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/paypal-consumer-fees#ReceivingDonations)

#### Patreon

8% fee + payment processing fees depending on what processor you used + currency conversion fees (if applicable).<br>
Plus a $0.25 fee whenever I cash out.<br>
Seriously dastardly fees, all taken from the creator! Shameful!<br>
Stay away from this shit unless you have to for some reason!

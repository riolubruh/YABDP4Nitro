## Emoji Bypasses

Allows you to seamlessly use animated emojis and emojis from any server you're in by linking or uploading them!

### Upload Emotes

Automatically uploads the emojis used in your message as an attachment!

![Uploading Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/191621033-da0db3f6-c5f6-4ba7-9c99-0c8ccf7ed864.gif)
___

### Ghost Mode 
<!-- spoopy!!! -->
Hide the link(s) to any emoji(s) you send by automatically using a "ghost message"! It is a bit more laggy and may be detected as spam by some bots.

![Ghost Mode Image Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/166120840-50bd98c7-48d0-4772-8d9b-17280e247a02.png)
___

### Classic Mode

When both Ghost Mode and Upload Emotes are disabled, we simply replace the emoji in the message with its' URL. This is "classic mode".

#### Usage of the Emoji Bypass

![Emoji Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/166121643-58b06bc5-c0a5-4e45-a7e9-c135337b7ed0.gif)

## Profile

### Profile Accents for All Users

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/199860419-7e3275e0-fdf5-49cf-a7c3-89f3105d1867.png" alt="visual difference with it on" width="25%"></img><--[New Look] [Original Look]--><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54255074/199860495-19312500-3f37-4c3d-a54a-1c04af68e826.png" alt="visual difference with it off" width="25%"></img>

To clarify: What this does is make **all profiles** render with the gradient accent on the **client-side**.

We'll get into profile accents that other users can see in a second.
___

### Fake Profile Themes

Allows profile theming by hiding color information in your bio using invisible 3y3 encoding!<br>
Works effectively exactly the same as FakeProfileThemes on Vencord, but on BetterDiscord!<br>
![Fake Profile Themes Demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/dcb7b2fb-fdad-4d2d-8d87-b79fcabd8e9a)

Happy theming!

**Note that only users that have either YABDP4Nitro, FakeProfileThemes (Vencord), UnrealProfileThemes (Enmity), or a similar plugin (that decodes 3y3-encoded profile colors) installed will be able to see the profile colors.**
___

### Fake Profile Banners

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting profile banners by hiding the image URL in your bio.<br>
Only supports Imgur URLs for security reasons.

![Fake Profile Banners Big Yosher](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/f7edda1f-531b-45b8-bc8b-ee50d5c5cfdb)

To use Fake Profile Banners, go to Settings>Profiles. You should see a new text input and 
"Copy 3y3" button under the Profile Banners section:

![Profile Settings](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/facc8c27-5353-4205-b001-5b9c62375d6e)

<br>
Simply type/paste in an Imgur URL into the input area

(ex: **`https://i.imgur.com/bYGGXnq.gif`**. **The file extension is required!**)

Then, click the "Copy 3y3" button to the right of the input area, paste your clipboard into your "About Me" (or bio) and save.

The banner should appear in the "Try It Out" preview to let you know that it is working correctly.

**Note that only other users with YABDP4Nitro installed and enabled will be able to see this.**
___

### Fake Avatar Decorations

Uses invisible 3y3 encoding to allow setting avatar decorations by hiding IDs in your bio.

![avatar decoration demonstration](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/005379d8-5d6f-43e9-8735-b44788560831)

To use Fake Avatar Decorations, go to Settings>Profiles you should see a new button under Avatar Decoration.

![deco-button](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/0b5547e0-2947-4628-a3da-a91f9ee1c933)

Clicking this button will reveal a menu with each of the avatar decorations in a 4x5 grid.

![avatar decorations](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/54597f3e-b115-44dd-9804-3aee5d9c99b3)

Clicking one of these avatar decorations will copy the invisible 3y3-encoded data into your clipboard.
<br>Now follow one or both of the following methods to apply the avatar decoration to your profile:

<details>
 <summary>
 Custom Status 
</summary>
 Now that you have the 3y3 encoded data in your clipboard:
 
 Close settings by pressing Escape or hitting the button labeled ESC in the top right.

 Click on your profile in the bottom left to open this menu:
 
 ![profile](https://github.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/assets/54255074/2e48a60a-b235-48fd-a93f-b14c6a2ba695)

 Click the button to add/edit your custom status and paste your clipboard into your status.

 You should now see the avatar decoration appear around your profile picture!
</details>

<details>
 <summary>
 About Me / Profile Bio
</summary>
 Now that you have the 3y3 encoded data in your clipboard:
 <br>Paste your clipboard into the About Me section of your profile.

 Demonstration:

 **Note: If your Avatar Decoration is in the About Me section of your profile, it will only appear for other users *after* they have opened your profile at least once.**
 
</details>

<br>
Any other user of YABDP4Nitro with Fake Avatar Decorations enabled will now be able to see your avatar decoration.

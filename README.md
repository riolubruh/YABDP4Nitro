# YABDP4Nitro

*Probably* the best "Nitro plugin" out there.

# Features

## Fully Customizable Screensharing Quality, FPS, and Bitrate

## Emoji Bypass

Use emoji from any of your servers by linking or uploading them!

### Ghost Mode

Hide the links to any emoji you send by automatically using a "ghost message"! Works mid-sentence and when sending multiple emoji at once, though it is a bit more laggy.

### Upload Emotes

Don't like abusing bugs? You can always upload the emojis as a file, if you want to.

## Miscellaneous

### Profile Accents for All Users

To clarify: What this does is make all profiles render with the gradient on the **client-side**. Other users will not see this.

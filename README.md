# YABDP4Nitro

*Probably* the best "Nitro plugin" out there.

# Features

## Fully Customizable Screensharing Quality, FPS, and Bitrate

## Emoji Bypass

Use emoji from any of your servers by linking or uploading them!

### Ghost Mode

Hide the links to any emoji you send by automatically using a "ghost message"! Works mid-sentence and when sending multiple emoji at once, though it is a bit more laggy.

### Upload Emotes

Don't like abusing bugs? You can always upload the emojis as a file, if you want to.

To clarify: What this does is make **all profiles** render with the gradient on the **client-side**.

We'll get into profile accents that other users can see in a bit.

### Fake Profile Themes

Allows profile theming by hiding color information in your bio using invisible 3y3 encoding!

Works effectively exactly the same as FakeProfileThemes on Vencord, but on BetterDiscord!

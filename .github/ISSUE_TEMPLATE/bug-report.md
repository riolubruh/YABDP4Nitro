**Delete this template when you go to submit it, just follow these guidelines:**

1. Explain how you got the error. If there were multiple steps, list them.
2. Provide screenshots of console output and/or error messages including before *and* after the error occurred.
3. If the error occurs with specific files, for example, a certain type of video not uploading properly while other videos do upload, provide a download link for the file(s) where the error occurs.
4. If a network-related error occurs, if possible please provide information about it using the Network tab of DevTools, but **do not leak your Discord login token!** Censor anything labelled "**Authorization**".
5. If you don't know how to do any of that, contact me on Discord instead.

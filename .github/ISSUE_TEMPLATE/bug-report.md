DELETE this template when you go to submit it, just follow these guidelines:

0. Make absolutely sure that you are on the latest version of the plugin.
Delete and redownload it just in case!

1. Explain how you got the error. If there were multiple steps, list them.

2. Provide screenshots of console output and/or error messages including before *and* after the error occurred.

3. If the error occurs with specific files, for example, a certain type of video not uploading properly while other videos do upload, provide a download link for the file(s) where the error occurs.

4. If a network-related error occurs, if possible please provide information about it using the Network tab of DevTools, but DO NOT LEAK YOUR DISCORD LOGIN TOKEN! Censor anything labelled "Authorization".

5. If you don't know how to do any of that, contact me on Discord instead.
